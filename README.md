# Song Database Test

This project is a full-stack web application that reads a CSV file containing data about songs,
transforms it into lowercase letters and saves it into a database. Then, all songs data
from the database is displayed in a table ordered by the band name.
This program allows users to delete, filter and sort songs by any property in the table.
